         <span><strong>Patronus:</strong> Stag </span><br/>
         <span><strong>Series Role:</strong> Harry Potter. The Boy Who Lived. He earned this title on Halloween night, 1981. On that night, Voldemort murdered his parents and attempted to murder baby Harry. However, Harry's mother's love for him protected him from the killing curse and it instead deflected at Voldemort, killing that piece of the dark wizard's soul. Harry Potter is the only survivor of the killing curse (avada kedavra), one of the three unforgivable curses. Since that night, Harry was a participant in a prophecy. Voldemort had 'marked him as his equal' and Harry would be the only one with the power to defeat the evil wizard. He grew up in the care of his magic-hating muggle family, the Dursleys. When he reached age eleven, he attended Hogwarts and became fast friends with Hermione and Ronald (see below). Each year he battled Voldemort, his death eaters, or people that denied the dark wizard's existence. </span>

         <span><strong>Patronus:</strong> Otter </span><br/>
         <span><strong>Series Role:</strong> Hermione Granger is the smartest witch of her age. The sorting hat is rumored to almost have sorted her into Ravenclaw rather than Gryffindor. She is the brains behind the 'golden trio'. Coming from a muggle past, she faced much discrimination in the wizarding world. During the war with Voldemort, she even had to obliviate her parents, the equivalent of erasing any memories they had of ever having a daughter. Often times, Hermione was the one to think calmly in stressful situations and figure a safe way out for her the boys. </span>

         <span><strong>Patronus:</strong> Jack Russell Terrier </span><br/>
         <span><strong>Series Role:</strong>Ronald Weasley was the first real friend that Harry Potter made in the wizarding world. He is known for his hot-headedness and his loyalty. While Ron really isn't the brightest of students, he does possess very refined strategic skills (as seen in his love for chess). Ron comes from a large family and has always been used to sharing, so he easily welcomed Harry into his family. The two practically became brothers. He was keeper (goalie) for the quidditch team and was obsessed with the professional version of quidditch. During the series he was often a companion that Harry could rely on for support. However, Ron did stray away a few times. However, he returned each time with an even stronger bond of loyalty to Harry and Hermione.</span>

         <span><strong>Patronus:</strong> none </span><br/>
         <span><strong>Series Role:</strong>Draco Malfoy is the only son to one of the most well known (technically suspected) death eaters. He grew up on the dark side of the war. During his time at Hogwarts, he attempted to be Harry's friend but his contempt for Weasleys and muggle borns turned Harry away from him. This led him down a dark path. In Slytherin, he became a leader and began to follow in his father's footsteps. He was initially excited to also serve the dark lord. However, when he was given the dark mark Voldemort have him a difficult task. This task was meant to be impossible for the boy so that he would fail and Voldemort could easily murder him (all because his father made a mistake). Draco's task was to murder Dumbledore. At almost seventeen, Draco had to face his task. He knew the consequences of failure and began to regret decisions that forced him to be marked by Voldemort. In the end, Draco could not kill Dumbledore and instead Snape did for him. When Harry finally ended the rein of terror that Voldemort had on the wizarding world, Draco was finally freed.</span>
