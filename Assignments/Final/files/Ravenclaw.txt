The house of the intelligent and creative, Ravenclaw is the house of the eagles (and home to Luna Lovegood, Gilderoy Lockhart, and Cho Chang). The character traits of this house are: wit, learning, and wisdom. Generally, Ravenclaws are regarded as the smart and bookish.

Decorated in blue and bronze, Ravenclaw tower is guarded by a bronze eagle-shaped knocker. This knocker poses logical riddles to students attempting to gain access into the tower. A logical answer must be given in order to enter. Additionally, Ravenclaws are supported by their house ghost: The Grey Lady. Her real name is Helena Ravenclaw and is the daughter of the Ravenclaw founder.

During the time of Harry Potter's education, the head of Ravenclaw was Filius Flitwick. Additionally, one of the more quirky Defence Against The Dark Arts professors Gilderoy Lockhary was a Ravenclaw. He went on to becoming a famous writer.

The house of Ravenclaw was founded by Rowena Ravenclaw during medieval times. While alive, she selected students based on their intelligence and wisdom. Like the other founders, she also possessed a magical artifact. Her's was a diadem that Tom Riddle (Voldemort) would later taint as a horcrux to ensure his immortality.
