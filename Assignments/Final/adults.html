         <span><strong>Series Role:</strong> During his time at Hogwarts, Tom was a very intelligent student. He was said to have a way with people and passion for learning. He grew up in an orphanage and longed to escape the muggle world. Over time, he grew obsessed with leaving the muggle world (as every summer he was returned to the orphanage) and hated the muggles who hated him. Tom began his attempt to take over magical Britain and rid the world of muggles. In his attempts, he also pursued immortality in the form of horcuxes. Horcruxes are physical objects that hold fragments of people's souls and can only be created through murder. In the end, he had seven horcruxes. To fully leave his muggle heritage behind, he changed his name to Voldemort (by twisting his very own name into the phrase 'I am Lord Voldemort'). However, as he began his rein as a dark lord, a prophecy fortelling his downfall came to be. The object of this prophecy turned out to be Harry Potter. Voldemort unintentionally fufilled part of the prophecy by murdering Harry's parents and accidentally creating a horcrux in the baby. Nearly every year of Harry's schooling, Voldemort faced and was defeated by the boy. In Harry's final year, he destroyed Voldemort completely.</span>
