	Over the summer, Harry Potter is visited by a house elf named Dobby who warns Harry not to return to Hogwarts. When Harry tells the elf that he has to return, Dobby begins wreaking havoc on the Dursley home. In repsonse, the Dursleys lock Harry in his bedroom. Concerned with the lack of correspondence from Harry, Ron and his two brothers Fred and George break Harry out of his muggle home. 
	The rest of his summer is spent with the Weasleys. While shopping for school supplies with said family, Harry encounters the new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor. Lockhart is very focused on his fame, and demands that Harry join him in his photo shoot. Later in the book store, Harry runs into Draco's father, Lucius Malfoy, who almosts starts a fight with Mr Weasley. The rest of the summer passes without incident and the boys go with the Weasleys to the train platform. However, when they go to pass through the wall they find that it is sealed. As a result, they steal the Weasley's flying family car and fly to Hogwarts. Their flight to school didn't go well, however, and on their arrival they were given detention.
