					<h2>The History of Harry Potter</h2>
					<img src="images/home/history.jpg">
					<div align="left">
						<p>The Harry Potter series is a group of seven books written by JK Rowling.
						The first book, <em>Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone</em>, was published
						in 1997. The final book, <em>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</em>, was 
						published in 2007. The series was quick to take off, and became one of the most 
						read childrens' books.</p>
						<p>On November 14 in 2001, Warner Bros studios released the first of the Harry 
						Potter series as a two hour and forty minute film. The star actors, Daniel Radcliffe, 
						Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson, along with their costars followed the movies until the 
						last release (of the second part of the last book) on July 11, 2011.</p>
						<p>Along with a successful book and movie series, Universal Studios opened a "Wizarding 
						World of Harry Potter" theme park on July 8, 2014. The park includes recreations of several 
						key places found in the Harry Potter world.</p>

					<h2>What's Harry Potter About?</h2>
					<img src="images/home/about.jpg">
					<div align="left">
						<p>The Harry Potter series, in general, is about an orphan boy who discovers he is a wizard destined 
						to do great things. Harry Potter's parents were murdered by a dark wizard when he was only a baby. 
						As a result, the headmaster of his parent's wizarding school (and a trusted friend of his parents) 
						left him on the doorstep of his Aunt's house in the nonmagical (muggle) world. Harry grew up with no 
						knowledge of magic and hated by his family.</p> 
						<p>Upon his eleventh birthday, he entered the magical world and learned the true story about his parents 
						and their lives. As he grows up and goes through his seven years of schooling at Hogwarts, he faces 
						many challenges that strengthen him as a wizard and as a man. All of this leads up to the final battle 
						between him and the evil wizard (Voldemort) where Harry ends the reign of terror held by the Voldemort 
						and his Death Eaters.</p>

						<h4>Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry</h4>
						<p>Located on Mount Greylock in Massachusetts, Ilvermorny is the top magical education in north america. 
						Founded in 1627 (637 years younger than Hogwarts) by an Irish Witch and her muggle husband, Ilvermorny 
						began is a small home school. The first major groups of students were Native Americans who already possessed 
						knowledge of magic. In return for sharing their knowledge, they were taught technique in wandwork. From 
						there, the school truly began to grow in size and students.</p>
						<p>Like Hogwarts, there are four houses for students to be sorted into. Rather than a sorting hat, students 
						step onto a Gordian Knot on the floor of the entrance hall. Around this knot are carvings of the mascots for 
						each of the four houses. If a carving reacts to the student, then the student is sorted into that house. The 
						four houses are: Horned Serpent, Wampus, Thunderbird, and Pukwudgie.</p>
						<h4>Government</h4>
						<p>As this is America, the magical world is also run by a democratic government. There is an elected President 
						and the Magical Congress (MACUSA). The central building for the magical world is located in New York City, New 
						York in the Woolworth Building. MACUSA was modelled off of the Wizengamot in Great Britain. Representatives from 
						across the country are elected to MACUSA to create laws for wizards.</p>
